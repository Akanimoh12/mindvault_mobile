# Native Project Generation

The `android/` and `ios/` directories are generated at build time from `app.json`, EAS configuration, and `expo-updates` settings. They are **not committed** to version control.

## Why Continuous Native Generation?

- **Single source of truth**: Configuration lives in `app.json`, `eas.json`, and environment-specific EAS profiles, not in multiple places
- **No drift**: The generated native projects always match the configuration, preventing version mismatches
- **Cleaner diffs**: Pull requests don't include generated build artifacts
- **Smaller repository**: No need to track 43+ generated files, including keystores and build artifacts

## Building Locally

Most day-to-day work needs no native folders at all:

```bash
npx expo start            # Expo Go or a development build
```

To build and run native code locally, generate the projects from `app.json`,
then run them. Generated folders are gitignored; regenerate rather than edit them.

```bash
npx expo prebuild --clean          # (re)generate android/ and ios/ from app.json
npx expo run:android               # build and run on an emulator or device
npx expo run:ios                   # macOS with Xcode only
```

`--clean` deletes and regenerates the folders, so a stale native project never
drifts from the config. Release builds go through EAS, which runs prebuild for
you (see [RELEASE.md](RELEASE.md)):

```bash
npx eas-cli build --profile preview --platform android
```

## Configuration

All native settings come from:

1. **`app.json`** (and `app.config.js`): name, version, icons, splash, permissions, plugins and `updates`.
2. **`eas.json`**: build profiles, channels and distribution.
3. **Config plugins** listed in `app.json` `plugins`, e.g. `expo-camera` for the camera permission text.

## Changing native configuration

Never edit `android/` or `ios/` directly: the next `prebuild --clean` or EAS
build discards the change.

1. Change `app.json`, or add a plugin's options there.
2. Run `npx expo prebuild --clean` and check the generated result.
3. Build and test with `npx expo run:android` / `run:ios`.

If no existing option or plugin covers what you need, write a small local
[config plugin](https://docs.expo.dev/config-plugins/introduction/) and add it
to `plugins`.
